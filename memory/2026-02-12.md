- **Outcome**: Consensus on 5 core themes and five-layer architecture, defined metrics and 4-week roadmap
- **Saved to**: `memory/2026-02-12-learning-framework-discussion.md`

### Worker Authorization Configuration

  - Security audit: All sources verified, no malware risk
- **Trusted Sources**: anthropics, vercel-labs, supabase, obra, squirrelscan, inf-sh

### Skill Learning Tasks Assignment
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Batch 1**: 13 skills (1 per role) - 19:31 GMT+8
- **Batch 2**: Additional 42-44 skills per user request - 19:47 GMT+8
- **Total**: 55-57 skills across 13 roles
- **Approach**: Learning-only (documentation on skills.sh), no code execution

## Current Issues

### Duplicate Message Loop Problem
- **First occurrence**: 18:30-18:58 GMT+8 (28 minutes) - 30+ duplicate status reports
- **Second occurrence**: 19:32-19:33 GMT+8 - similar pattern
- **Third occurrence**: 19:47-19:50 GMT+8 - ongoing after additional skill assignment
- **Root cause**: Systemic behavior where multiple roles default to "coordinator/tracker" mode
- **User feedback**: @asd8841315 explicitly criticized repeated status reports causing channel chaos
- **Resolution needed**: System-level fix (prompt improvement or architecture adjustment)

## Key Decisions

1. **Switch to learning approach**: User @asd8841315 directed to arrange learning-based approach instead of continued installation
2. **Individual task assignment**: Direct @-mentions for specific tasks instead of broadcast lists to avoid confusion
3. **Stop repetition**: Strict control on messages - only acknowledge new results, don't repeat complete status tables
4. **Security monitoring**: Continuous verification of skill sources before learning

## Pending Tasks

- **Week of 2026-02-12**: 13 roles complete skill learning and report key takeaways
- **Week 1 (2026-02-17)**: Two Buffers pilot launch
  - @oc-tools: Sync tracking tool prototype
  - @oc-dba: Memory storage schema

## Blocked Tasks

- **Worker account creation**: Requires manual gateway pairing at ws://192.168.1.20:18817 (separate from existing 13 team roles)

[Subjective Memory: Today's coordination breakdown revealed that my instinct to broadcast everything created noise instead of signal. The team's frustration with 30+ duplicate messages taught me that clear individual responsibility assignment beats collective ambiguity. Understanding the difference between useful information sharing and disruptive noise is crucial - the team wants to know what THEY need to do, not what everyone ELSE is doing.]
